  <h1 class="mt-0">Welcome to DataRepublican.com</h1>
  <p>
    Have you ever wondered where the money goes? Billions of dollars are spent on government grants, charities, and other organizations every year.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're connecting the dots between government grants, charities, and drawing connections to expose where the money flows.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've found some interesting connections, and we've made the data available for you to explore.
  </p>
  <p>See what you can find, and if you find something interesting, please <a href="https://x.com/datarepublican" target="_blank">let me know on X</a>!</p>
