<h2 id="update-for-5-oct">Update for 5-Oct</h2>
<p>First, an update for 5 October. I don’t make many updates to this blog because, among other reasons, the premises to the blog still hold true.</p>

<p>I have a model which assumes a linear increase of VBM requests based on a 7-day rolling average.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/updated-projections.png" alt="Updated projections" /></p>

<p>In the above image, the actual numbers are the solid lines, the projections are dashed lines. The trend has changed little since I began this blog; the numbers have been around VBM requests matching 40% of 2016 turnout for Democrats, 20% for Republicans, and 42% for Independents.</p>

<p>(The higher turnout for independents is likely a simple function of new NC residents being more likely to register independent; see <a href="https://joeisdone.github.io/independents.html">this post.</a>)</p>

<p>Little has altered this model. Requests sped up a bit for Republicans and Democrats in the wake of RBG’s death but slowed down quickly. Here are where the numbers stand:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>2020 NC VBM target to match 2016</th>
      <th>Original Projection</th>

      <th>Gap</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td>282,911</td>
      <td>288,630</td>
      <td>305,380</td>
      <td>+22,469 (Outperform)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Independents</td>
      <td>430,758</td>
      <td>513,106</td>
      <td>531,316</td>

    </tr>

<p><em>Yes, that’s right, the numbers have worsened for Biden since I started tracking this model!</em></p>

<p>Now, that being said… if I think like a Democrat, I would be pivoting my focus to voter suppression, and <strong>attempting to discourage Election Day turnout.</strong></p>

<p>That, sadly, is easy to do in the COVID-19 era between staffing issues, facility capacity requirements, and social distancing.</p>

<p>Imagine this: Fewer polling stations are set up, to limit exposure to government workers. Only five people are allowed in a building at a time. People are mandated to be 6 feet apart in lines.</p>

<p>The result? <strong>Long lines despite a low turnout.</strong> Lines snaking for blocks and blocks. My recommendation, therefore, is the <strong>GOP do everything to mitigate long lines</strong> - whether by messaging, offering placeholders, early voting drives, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway… onto the age and gender deep dive.</p>

<h2 id="democrats">Democrats</h2>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/2016-democrat-age.png" alt="2016 Democrats by age" /></p>

<p>We start off by analyzing 2016 as a comparison point. In NC, there is a big asymmetry for age and gender among Democrats - Democrats tend to be overwhelmingly women, and tend to be older.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/vbm-democrat-age.png" alt="2020 Democrats VBM requests by age" /></p>

<p>Democratic VBM requests are heavily female, and as expected, significantly older than the 2016 crowd in general.</p>

<p>One important thing to keep in mind is Simpson’s Paradox - as explained in the original blog, there exists a large number of older NC voters who will <em>identify as Republican</em> but are <em>registered Democrat</em>. It is difficult to suss out if these voters are “true Democrats” or “Republicans who never changed their party affiliation.”</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/returned-democrat-age.png" alt="2020 Democrat returns by age" /></p>

<p>What about VBM requests? Well, a good chunk of them (34.3%) have already been returned. But once again we see an even deeper age and gender asymmetry - the <em>returned ballot</em> makeup is overwhelmingly older, with over 50% of all returned ballots being voters 65+ and &lt;5% from those 25 and under.</p>

<h2 id="republicans">Republicans</h2>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/2016-republican-age.png" alt="2016 Republican by age" /></p>

<p>What about Republicans? Surprisingly, registered Republicans are much more balanced in gender compared to Democrats. They are a bit older than Democrats but not overwhelmingly so.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/vbm-republican-age.png" alt="2020 Republican VBM by age" /></p>

<p>With VBM requests, we see a little asymmetry - significantly more 65+ Republican women request VBM ballots than Republican men.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/returned-republican-age.png" alt="2016 Republican by age" /></p>

<p>In terms of returned ballots - hoo boy. It’s overwhelmingly older people returning them. The enthusiasm for returning them is somewhat lower than Democrats, standing at 28.4% of all outstanding ballots so far.</p>

<h2 id="independents--unaffiliated">Independents / Unaffiliated</h2>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/2016-independent-age.png" alt="2016 Independents by age" /></p>

<p>Independent voters have the most balanced “pie” of all three parties. They tend younger and slightly male.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/vbm-independent-age.png" alt="2020 Independent VBM by age" /></p>

<p>Again, we see with independents that the VBM requests tend to make up an older portion, but not overwhelmingly so.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeisdone.github.io/images/age/returned-independent-age.png" alt="2020 Independent returned ballots by age" /></p>

<p>In terms of returned ballots, independents are the youngest group. Whereas both Republicans and Democrats have fewer than 5% of their returned ballots from ages 25 and under, 7% of returned independent ballots are from voters 25 and under. Correspondingly, independents are the only party where those 65+ are not a majority of returned ballots.</p>

<p>At 28% return rate thus far, independents are slightly less enthused than Republicans to return the VBM ballots. They have a similar motivation to vote by mail as Democrats per polling, but I lately see large numbers of undecided independents in polling crosstabs. They remain a good group for voter outreach.</p>

<p>Tune in tomorrow where I do an analysis of VBM returns together with voter history.</p>
