<h1 id="florida-prediction-edition">Florida Prediction edition</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://joeisdone.github.io/florida">Florida early voting</a> page has gone viral, and spawned a bunch of people speculating on what it all means. Is 480K too insurmountable of a lead for Republicans to overcome? Should Democrats be worried about the in-person early voting (IPEV) Republican performance? <em>Who should be worried, anyway?</em></p>

<p>This post attempts to answer that question. Richard Baris would call this useless tea-leaf reading, but tea-leaf reading is the only thing we have at this point.</p>

<h2 id="florida-isnt-like-other-states">Florida isn’t like other states</h2>

<p>The premise of “JoeIsDone” is that Democrats are not turning out the VBM numbers they need to win the election. That applies to a state like NC, but not FL so much. Why?</p>

<p>Florida already has a strong history of VBM and early voting, so it’s harder to infer how COVID-19 fears will impact Florida specifically.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://dos.myflorida.com/media/697363/early-voting-and-vote-by-mail-report-2016-gen.pdf">raw vote numbers from 2016</a> broken by party and method:</p>

<p>Put simply, in 2016, <strong>a full 70% of the electorate had already early voted.</strong> Trump came into the election with a <a href="http://www.electionczar.com/floridaearlyvote.html">96,450 point deficit</a>, which was then overcame with Republicans compromising 42% of the Election Day electorate.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-the-polls-say">What do the polls say?</h1>

<p>Currently, the best poll we have on how people will vote is probably the <a href="https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/FLFallOct2020.pdf">University of North Florida</a> poll that was released yesterday.</p>

<p>Within the crosstabs, we find the following vote preference by party registration:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Voting Method</th>
      <th>Democrat</th>
      <th>Republican</th>
      <th>NPA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>IPEV</td>
      <td>32%</td>
      <td>24%</td>
      <td>33%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mail</td>
      <td>55%</td>
      <td>37%</td>
      <td>37%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Election Day</td>
      <td>12%</td>
      <td>37%</td>
      <td>29%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Don’t know</td>
      <td>2%</td>
      <td>3%</td>
      <td>1%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Some oddities should jump out. For example, if the poll is to be believed, we should see a <em>larger proportion of Republicans turn out for Election Day than in 2016.</em> That doesn’t seem right, but Gallup says that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321602/extreme-partisan-gaps-early-voting-emerge-year.aspx">early voting has become a partisan issue</a>.</p>

<h1 id="reading-the-tea-leaves">Reading the tea leaves…</h1>

<p>Let’s read the tea leaves in the turnout. What if we cast 2016’s turnout to the poll numbers? We arrive at the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

<p>(We will ignore Don’t Knows.)</p>

<p>Obviously, this doesn’t align with our data. Republicans are lagging way behind on VBM, independents are way overperforming on VBM, Republicans are overperforming with early voting. .</p>

<p>But it’s the best we have.</p>

<p>But by that model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Republicans are <strong>63.23%</strong> to their EV target (1,433,537 / 2,267,079).</li>
  <li>Democrats are <strong>59.64%</strong> to their EV target (1,894,548 / 3,651,552).</li>
  <li>NPAs are <strong>57.35%</strong> to their EV target (795,910 / 1,387,789).</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you go out Tweeting that Republicans are actually kicking butt and taking names, there are many reasons to not to take this model as gospel.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It doesn’t match up with the real world data.</li>
  <li>We don’t know how the ‘don’t knows’ allocate.</li>
  <li>It is doubtful that Republicans will have higher turnout on Election Day 2020 than they did in 2016.</li>
  <li>The Democrats appear to have requested more VBM than their target would imply (2,631,697).</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly:</p>

<p><strong>It’s been only three days since IPEV started.</strong></p>

<p>The return rates and IPEV have been rather volatile.</p>

<h1 id="the-magic-numbers">The “magic numbers”</h1>

<p>There’s been extensive discussion of the “magic numbers” - aka the gap between Democrat and Republican VBM and IPEV to secure a victory.</p>

<p>From the raw model above, these would be 633,239 for VBM (which closely matches the one that’s been tossed around) and 276,528 for IPEV for a combined magic number of 909,767 (!).</p>

<p>But, again, there are many unknowns. Conservatively assigning all of the 2% “Unknown” to the Republican EV (-74,330) and 3% to the Democrat Election Day (-109,465) brings that number down to 725,972 (combined IPEV and VBM lead).</p>

<p>And finally, just because I don’t trust that 37% of Republicans will turn out on Election Day, I’d further conservatively knock off a 6% (-222,990).</p>

<p>That brings the “magic number” to 502,982. Higher turnout will push the number up and lower turnout will push the number down.</p>

<p>Overall, Florida isn’t going to be a cakewalk. But should be doable for Trump with a few more days like today’s.</p>

<p>All this article really is, is just tea leaf entertainment reading in the end.</p>

<h1 id="whats-a-good-advantage-for-trump">What’s a good “advantage” for Trump?</h1>

<p>One of the more discussed things about the Florida early voting is the “Advantage.”</p>

<p>At first, I measured the advantage as the R-D gap compared to the Trump-Hillary gap. I noticed this greatly favored blue counties at the expense of deep red counties, so I sought a fairer comparison.</p>

<p>So I based the advantage off the 2016 early voting R-D gap. But, again, since Democrats have declared a preference to early vote, this wasn’t completely fair either.</p>

<p>In 2016, 39.80% of early voters were Democrat, and 38.34% of early voters were Republican (39.8%-38.34%).</p>

<p>According to the above poll, and adding in the 3% unknowns plus 6% Election Day bias to the Republican part to bring their early vote targets to 2,601,566, the gap becomes 44%D-36%R.</p>

<p>That’s a 7 point swing, so I will keep the statement on the website that anything within 5% is good news.</p>
